Comments: Let's try simplifying to granting ATK and effects, which is more powerful, before increasing complexity to reduce power.

Name: Osiris the Black Flame Lord
Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Effect
Attribute: FIRE
Monster Type: Warrior
Effect(s): ① If this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the GY: You can add 1 "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV4" from your Deck to your hand.
ATK: 900
DEF: 0
Comments: This effect feels too defensive or self-detrimental, perhaps something to facilitate upgrading one Horus to the next more quickly. Horus LV8 can't upgrade further, so perhaps designing it in such a way that Horus LV8 also gets a benefit?

Name: Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV2
Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Effect
Attribute: FIRE
Monster Type: Dragon
Effect(s): ① During the End Phase, if you control this face-up card your opponent owns: Return control of this card to its owner. ② During your Standby Phase: You can send this card to the GY; Special Summon 1 "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV4" from your hand or Deck.
ATK: 900
DEF: 0
Comments: Had a look at some Goat format Horus decks, and the way they try to get Horus on the field would not be helped by Horus LV2's effect as is, and adding Masked Dragon to try and facilitate its summoning method would force you to consider removing the combos for cheating out Horus LV6. Needs re-working to provide helpful support.
