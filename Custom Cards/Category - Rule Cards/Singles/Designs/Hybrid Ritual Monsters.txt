① Ritual Monsters can be put in the Main Deck or the Extra Deck. ② Cards that Ritual Summon Ritual Monsters but don't specify where they are Summoned from can Ritual Summon them from the hand, Deck, or Extra Deck. ③ If a Ritual Monster that started the Duel in the Extra Deck is moved to the hand or Deck, it is moved to the Extra Deck instead. If a Ritual Monster that started the Duel in the Deck is moved to the Extra Deck, it is moved to the Deck instead. ④ Ritual Monsters that apply continous effects to themselves while in the hand or Deck also apply those effects while in the Extra Deck. ⑤ Ritual Monsters, Ritual Spells, and cards that mention them or Ritual Summoning but not other Extra Deck monster card types or Summoning mechanics, that prevent a player(s) from Special Summoning monsters from the Extra Deck prevent non-Ritual Monsters from being Special Summoned from the Extra Deck instead, or if they apply a continuous effect to all of a player's monsters Special Summoned from the Extra Deck, they apply that effect to non-Ritual Monsters Special Summoned from the Extra Deck instead.
Comments: Stripping out the parts that aren't strictly necessary to making Extra Deck Ritual Monsters work, and making it purely optional so players can use their discretion to put Ritual Monsters in the Main Deck or Extra Deck.
