Name: Hybrid Ritual Art
Card Type: Rule
Rules Text: ① Ritual Monsters can be put in the Main Deck or the Extra Deck. ② Cards that Ritual Summon Ritual Monsters but don't specify where they are Summoned from can Ritual Summon them from the hand, Deck, or Extra Deck. ③ If a Ritual Monster that started the Duel in the Extra Deck is moved to the hand or Deck, it is moved to the Extra Deck instead. If a Ritual Monster that started the Duel in the Deck is moved to the Extra Deck, it is moved to the Deck instead. ④ Ritual Monsters that apply continous effects to themselves while in the hand or Deck also apply those effects while in the Extra Deck. ⑤ Ritual Monsters, Ritual Spells, and cards that mention them or Ritual Summoning but not other Extra Deck monster card types or Summoning mechanics, that prevent a player(s) from Special Summoning monsters from the Extra Deck prevent non-Ritual Monsters from being Special Summoned from the Extra Deck instead, or if they apply a continuous effect to all of a player's monsters Special Summoned from the Extra Deck, they apply that effect to non-Ritual Monsters Special Summoned from the Extra Deck instead.
