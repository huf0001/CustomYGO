Comments: With a lot of people saying this should be more powerful, I might make the board wipe stronger and relax the win condition slightly, but if I want to make it just Summon = Win, that's not a very Yubel-esque card, and also it would need to be playtested to see if it would be broken in Gladiator Format.
