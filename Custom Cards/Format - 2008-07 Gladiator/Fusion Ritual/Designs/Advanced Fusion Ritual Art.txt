COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Using non-standard templating of "and, after that" to indicate both A and B are required but sequential. Both but sequential doesn't have a PSCT conjunctive to indicate it. So I am indicating it by adapting "and" (A and B required, simultaneous) in the same manner that "also, after that" (neither A or B required, sequential) adapts "also" (neither A or B required, simultaneous).

Name: Advanced Fusion Ritual Art
Card Type: Spell
Card Subtype(s): Normal
Rules Text: ① Reveal 1 Fusion Monster that must first be Special Summoned by a "Fusion Ritual" card or a "Fusion Ritual" card whose name it mentions; send Normal monsters from your Deck to the GY whose total Levels equal the Level of the revealed Fusion Monster, and, after that, Special Summon that Fusion Monster. (If the Fusion Monster must first be Special Summoned with a "Fusion Ritual" card whose name it mentions, this Special Summon is treated as a Special Summon with that card.)
Comments: Made Exxod's Summoning Condition easier for Advanced Fusion Ritual Art to support it, so I'm simplifying Advanced Fusion Ritual Art.
