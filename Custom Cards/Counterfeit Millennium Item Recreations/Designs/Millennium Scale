	SENN-JP003
	Effect
	This card can directly join the battle field and immediately activate its effect. As long as this card is on the field, the opponent must state the names of the top 3 cards of their Deck in order. If they are correct, those cards are sent to the Graveyard. However, if they make a mistake, this card is moved to your side of the field. This card is destroyed and cannot be revived if it is attacked twice.
