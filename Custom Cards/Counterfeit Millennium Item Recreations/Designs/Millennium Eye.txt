Name: Millennium Eye
Card Type: Spell
Card Subtype(s): Normal
Effect(s): ① (Quick Effect): You can activate this card from your hand or Deck. ② After this card's activation, it remains on the field. ③ Once per turn: Your opponent can target any number of face-up monsters they control; during their next turn, all of the targeted monsters must attack, if able, and other monsters they control cannot attack. 
Comments: Swapping Eye and Rod's effects, since they make more sense given to the other, removing the activate from anywhere effect because that's game-breaking, and adding the destruction-related effect of the other items for consistency. Millennium Rod's original text translated is as follows:

	Rod of the Sorcerer
	【Magic Card+】 (Equip)
	This card can be directly placed on the field and immediately activate its effect.
	As long as this card is on the field, you can see your opponent's hand, and your opponent must show you any card they draw.
	This card is sent to the Graveyard and cannot be revived if it is attacked twice.
