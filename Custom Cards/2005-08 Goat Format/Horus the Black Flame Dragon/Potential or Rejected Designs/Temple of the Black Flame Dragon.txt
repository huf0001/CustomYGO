COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep an eye on if effect ① should be restricted to triggering during the End Phase so that players can't suicide a Horus LV4 to summon LV6 and successfully attack for LV8 in a single turn.

If Osiris ends up ditching the effect-gain aspect of its effect, perhaps Temple could adopt it and make it its entire effect:

① The following effects of "Horus the Black Flame Dragon" monsters you control, based on those monsters' original levels, become the subsequent effect listed.
● 4: "Control of this face-up card cannot switch."
● 6: "This card is unaffected by Spell effects."
● 8: "When a Spell Card is activated (Quick Effect): You can negate the activation, and if you do, destroy it."
● 10: "Your opponent cannot activate Spell Cards or their effects on the field. Negate all Spell effects on your opponent's field."

Effect(s): You can only use effect ① of "Temple of the Black Flame Dragon" once per turn. ① During your End Phase Phase, if a monster battled this turn: You can send 1 Level 4 or lower "Horus the Black Flame Dragon" monster you control that was not Summoned this Phase to the GY; Special Summon 1 monster from your hand or Deck that is mentioned on the sent monster.
Comments: Had a look at Horus decks from Goat format, and TODO

Comments: If Horus LV2 is a Horus Armed Dragon LV3, upgrading during the Standby Phase steps on its toes. Maybe a different approach would work better.

Comments: Horus' Servant already provides Trap protection, so let's see if it doesn't need that effect.

Name: Temple of the Black Flame Dragon
Card Type: Spell
Card Subtype(s): Continuous
Effect(s): You can only use effect ① of "Temple of the Black Flame Dragon" once per turn. ① During your Standby Phase: You can Tribute 1 "Horus the Black Flame Dragon" monster you control; Special Summon 1 monster from your hand or Deck that is mentioned on that Tributed monster, ignoring its Summoning conditions, but it cannot activate its effects during the End Phase this turn. ② If your opponent activates a Trap Card that targets a "Horus the Black Flame Dragon" monster(s) you control: You can send this card to the GY; negate the activation, and if you do, destroy that card.
Comments: There's got to be a cleaner way to do effect ①. Plus, that makes Horus LV8 easier to summon than Armed Dragon LV7, since LV5 also requires monster destruction to summon LV7, the same as Horus LV6 for summoning LV8.
