COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Walhalla diesel, Viking Shunter, Shunter of the Gods, supports getting LV 3/4/10 into the GY / LV/RK 3/4/10 out of the GY? Or has a LV change effect affecting either itself or itself and another target monster it wants to have one adopt the level of the other?

"If you activate the effect of an EARTH Machine Xyz monster by detaching a material (Quick Effect): You can Special Summon this card (from your hand), and if you do, add the detached material to your hand.".... doesn't quite fit a divine Viking Shunter, but this effect might work for a different train monster? Consider.


As a Victorian narrow gauge locomotive, its total ATK/DEF should add to 2600.

Older engines could have a theme of getting the others out as they "build" the railway, while the younger engines could have a theme of recovering or resurrecting engines in the GY as "preservation" gets underway. At least one could have a recovery effect on being detached from an EARTH Machine Xyz Monster.

Alternative surviving standard-gauge Victorian tank engines include the DDE / D4 class, the E class, and the Z class, but none are operational either, only on display. The only operational Victorian Railways tank engines are the narrow gauge NA class, but they are covered by Locomotive NA - Mountain Tourist.
