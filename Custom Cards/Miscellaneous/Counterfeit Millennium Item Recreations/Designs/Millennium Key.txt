Basis: The Millennium Key
Flavour: Based on a counterfeit card for the Millennium Key, whose text is translated as follows:

	Thousand-Year Magician
	[Magic Card+] (Equip)
	SENN-JP004
	This card can be directly added to the battle field and its effect can be immediately activated. As long as this card is on the field, you can reverse time to the previous round, but you can only reverse time by 1 round at a time.

Name: Millennium Key
Card Type: Spell
Card Subtype(s): Normal
Effect(s): ① (Quick Effect): You can activate this card from your hand or Deck. ② After this card's activation, it remains on the field. ③ Once per turn: Return the Duel to the state it was in at the start of your last turn.

Comments: Removing the activate from anywhere effect, since that is game breaking, and adding the destruction-related effect of the other items for consistency.
