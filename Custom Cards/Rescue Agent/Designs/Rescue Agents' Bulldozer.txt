CREATIVE-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basis: Firefly
Flavour: The powerful bulldozer in amongst rubble for it to clear away, with a cannon to break up debris, and a debris shield to clear away any debris.


COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a 3-material Rank 4 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4500. Keep an eye on its indestructability effect, in case that makes Bulldozer too strong.

Name: Rescue Agent's Bulldozer
Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Xyz / Effect
Rank: 4
Attribute: FIRE
Monster Type: Machine
Materials: 3 Level 4 "Rescue Agent" monsters
Effect(s): Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can detach 1 material from this card, then target 1 face-up monster your opponent controls; change its ATK to 0 until the end of this turn. Cannot be destroyed by battle while it has a material. Monsters destroyed by battle with this card are attached to this card instead of going to the GY.
ATK: 2400
DEF: 2100
Comments: All Extra Deck monsters should share the same battle effect. If Bulldozer uses its effect, it shouldn't be able to attack during the same turn, that's probably a bit too much for it to be able to clear the opponent's board and attack in the same turn.
