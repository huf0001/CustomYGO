COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a Level 10 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 6000, but because it is a satellite that does not actively participate in rescue missions, its total is lower. Keep an eye on if preventing destruction by card effects is a bit too strong, or if the restriction of immunity only when there's another Rescue Agent Extra Deck monster is enough of a weakness.

Comments: Let's see if raising it to Level 10 and giving it an extra effect might increase its potency, becuase it's not quite enough compared to Starship and Carrier to be worth bringing out.
