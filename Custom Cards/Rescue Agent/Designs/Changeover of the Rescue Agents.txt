Name: Rescue Agent's Changeover
Card Type: Trap
Card Subtype(s): Normal
Effect(s): Target 1 "Rescue Agent" mosnter you control; Shuffle it into the Deck, and apply the appropriate effect based on its card type:
● Synchro: Special Summon 1 "Rescue Agent" Synchro monster with a different name from your Extra Deck. (This is treated as a Synchro Summon.)

Comments: The name needs updating to make it gramatically clearer for multiple Rescue Agents. Also, this card should probably not be used to cheat out higher level / more materials Synchro and Xyz monsters, so let's add restrictions on that and see how long that makes the effect.
