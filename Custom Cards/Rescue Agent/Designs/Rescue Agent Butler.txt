As a Level 4 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 2900. As a criminal monster, its attribute should be DARK, and its ATK/DEF should be multiples of 50, not 100.

Name: Rescue Agent Butler
Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Effect
Level: 4
Attribute: DARK
Monster Type: Warrior
Effect(s): If your opponent activates a card or effect that targets 1 "Rescue Agent" monster you control: You can send this card from your hand to the GY, then target 1 card on the field that would be appropriate target; that card or effect now targets the new target. You can only activate this effect of "Rescue Agent Butler" once per turn.
ATK: 1850
DEF: 1050
Comments: There's some tension between having this card in hand for its effect and being able to use it to Summon Rescue Agent monsters from the Extra Deck, so let's see if banishing from the GY isn't too strong. This way, it will now synergise with Spy as well. Also, the effect needs to be a Quick Effect to work, and has a missing word.

Name: Butler of the Rescue Agents
Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Effect
Level: 4
Attribute: DARK
Monster Type: Warrior
Effect(s): If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: target 1 Spell/Trap in your opponent's GY; this effect becomes that target's effect when that card is activated.
ATK: 1850
DEF: 1050
Comments: There's no guarantee the opponent will have a useable Spell/Trap in the GY to copy, so maybe a different "stealing" effect would work better. Also, might be worth renaming to shorten its name.
