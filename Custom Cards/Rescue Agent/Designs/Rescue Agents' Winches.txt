Basis: The Recovery Vehicles
Flavour: Twin tractors with powerful magnets attached to winches, designed to pull large vehicles out of holes.


COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a 2-material Rank 4 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000. Keep an eye on if just removing monsters from the GY is enough, or if Spell/Trap cards should be fair game as well.

Name: Rescue Agent's Winches
Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Xyz / Effect
Rank: 4
Attribute: EARTH
Monster Type: Machine
Materials: 2 Level 4 "Rescue Agent" monsters
Effect(s): Once per turn: You can detach 1 material from this card, then target 1 monster in either GY: return that target to the hand. Monsters destroyed by battle with this card are attached to this card instead of going to the GY.
ATK: 1800
DEF: 2200
Comments: Extra Deck monsters should all share the same battle effect. Also, returning to the hand doesn't play into the theme of shuffling cards into the Deck.
