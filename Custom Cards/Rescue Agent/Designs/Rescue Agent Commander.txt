Comments: I keep forgetting to apply the ATK/DEF gain effect, so maybe having it apply fully for a limited period will be easier to keep track of. That effect can also be shortened slightly.

Card Subtype(s): Tuner / Effect
Level: 4
Attribute: WIND
Monster Type: Warrior
Effect(s): You can discard this card; add 1 "Rescue Agents' Island" from your Deck to your hand.
ATK: 2100
DEF: 800
Comments: If Commander is going to have a bonus effect for monsters Summoned using it as material, then 2100 ATK is too high. Also, its effect text needs adjusting after renaming Island anyway. Also, shortening the effect adding effect.
