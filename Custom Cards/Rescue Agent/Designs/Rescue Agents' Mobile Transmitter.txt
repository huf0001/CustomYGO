COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a 2-material Rank 4 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000.

Name: Rescue Agent's Mobile Transmitter
Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Xyz / Effect
Rank: 4
Attribute: LIGHT
Monster Type: Machine
Materials: 2 Level 4 "Rescue Agent" monsters
Effect(s): Once per turn (Quick Effect): You can detach 1 material from this card, then target 1 other monster on the field; change it to face-up Attack Position or face-down Defense Position. Monsters destroyed by battle with this card are attached to this card instead of going to the GY.
ATK: 2200
DEF: 1800
Comments: Extra Deck monsters should all share the same battle effect. Also, Starship also has a battle position changing effect, so let's limit this one to just changing position, not flipping face down, and to being Spell Speed 1, not a Quick Effect. That said, it would be better if one of the two had a different effect, and the other had the full power effect.
