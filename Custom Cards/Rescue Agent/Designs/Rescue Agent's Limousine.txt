COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a Level 6 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000.

Name: Rescue Agent's Limousine
Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Fusion / Effect
Level: 6
Attribute: LIGHT
Monster Type: Machine
Materials: "Rescue Agent Spy" or "Rescue Agent Butler" + 1 "Rescue Agent" monster
Effect(s): Must first be Special Summoned (from your Extra Deck) by shuffling the above cards you control into the Deck. (You do not use "Polymerization".) If this card is Special Summoned: You can target 1 random card in your opponent's hand or 1 card in their GY: add it to your hand. Monsters destroyed by battle with this card are returned to the hand instead of going to the GY. Once per turn, when your "Rescue Agent" monster is targeted for an attack: You can negate that attack.
ATK: 2300
DEF: 1700
Comments: The destroyed by battle effects of Rescue Agent monsters should be standardized to shuffling them into the Deck. Also, if we're not doing hand destruction anymore, Limousine needs a new on-Summon effect, so how about using the effects of monsters milled by Spy? For consistency with the Synchro monsters, this effect should only activate on being Fusion Summoned, and to make life easier with the Tuner monster's effect adding effects and Launch and Starship's quick Summon effects, Limousine should be Fusion Summonable, and its own procedure should be treated as a Fusion Summon.
