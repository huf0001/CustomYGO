CREATIVE-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basis: The Mole
Flavour: A mobile drill for rescuing people trapped under collapsed buildings and other obstructions.


COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a 2-material Rank 4 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000.
