CREATIVE-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basis: The Master Elevator Car
Flavour: A mobile platform for catching falling planes, and which can control 2 other remote control Elevator Cars.


COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a 2-material Rank 4 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000.

Comments: The battle effects of all Rescue Agent Extra Deck monsters should be made the same. Also, wanting to use Tokens for Synchro plays works against wanting them for ATK, so perhaps the ATK gain effect should be adjusted to encourage using the Tokens, not holding onto them.
