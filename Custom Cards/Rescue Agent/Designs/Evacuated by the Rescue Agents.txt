Name: Airlifted by the Rescue Agents
Card Type: Trap
Card Subtype(s): Normal
Effect(s): Target 1 card on the field; shuffle it into the Deck. You must control a "Rescue Agent" monster to activate and to resolve this effect.
Comments: Might need some more effects to make it a better pick for Rescue Agent decks than the likes of Compulsory Evacuation Device. Also, might tweak the name to "Evacuated" rather than "Airlifted", as that's more generic.
