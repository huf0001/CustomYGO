COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a Level 8 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 5000.

Comments: There's some imbalance in utility between Carrier and Starship, so let's try swapping some effects: Carrier gets Starship's on-Summon effect, and Starship gets Carrier's Quick Effect. Also, let's see how it's on-Summon effect fares being restricted to Synchro Summons, not just whenever it's Special Summoned.
