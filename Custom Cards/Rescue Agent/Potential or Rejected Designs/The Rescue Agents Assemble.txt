Basis: Gathering the Elevator Cars.

COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This card's effect got adopted by Unloading the Rescue Agent Machines after Launch of the Rescue Agents took all the up front quick Extra Deck Summon effects. Therefore, this card is being relegated to potential ideas in case a new design for this card's flavour can be devised, and there's room in the archetype for another card.
