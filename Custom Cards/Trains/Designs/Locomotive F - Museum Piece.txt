COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Museum piece, cannot attack? 
Was converted from a tender-engine, so can be treated as a Level 10?
Oldest, so discard to summon another one from your hand?

Older engines could have a theme of getting the others out as they "build" the railway, while the younger engines could have a theme of recovering or resurrecting engines in the GY as "preservation" gets underway. At least one could have a recovery effect on being detached from an EARTH Machine Xyz Monster.

Alternative surviving standard-gauge Victorian tank engines include the DDE / D4 class, the E class, and the Z class, but none are operational either, only on display. The only operational Victorian Railways tank engines are the narrow gauge NA class, but they are covered by Locomotive NA - Mountain Tourist.
