CREATIVE-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basis: Victorian Railways' S class locomotives which pulled the Spirit of Progress express service between Melbourne and Albury, but all were scrapped immediately when dieselisation began in Victoria, sparking Victoria's preservation movement.
Flavour: ABCDEF
Artwork: Created in GIMP using:
● 


COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternative name ideas: Scrapped (except that would make it a Scrap card), Dieselisation, Under the Cutter's Torch.

The S-class locomotive could have a rusted colour and an X drawn through it on yellowed paper, with the page burning up to reveal a diesel underneath. 

Alternative artwork idea: the image linked below of a B class diesel passing an S class locomotive could have a similar treatment without the burn marks, highlighting the B class as the future. However, this would give the B class too much prominence when the focus should be on the demise of the S class.

Older engines could have a theme of getting the others out as they "build" the railway, while the younger engines could have a theme of recovering or resurrecting engines in the GY as "preservation" gets underway. At least one could have a recovery effect on being detached from an EARTH Machine Xyz Monster.
