COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

R class should have a black and red livery.

Named for 4-6-4 wheel arrangement, which has the nicknames "Baltic" and "Hudson". "Hudson" seems to be the name used in Australia, so that's what I'm going with.

Alternate name: Glaswegian Helenus, as the R class was built in Glasgow, Scotland, and R761, the planned photo basis, was brought to Australia along with R759 onboard the ship Helenus on 28/02/1952.

Older engines could have a theme of getting the others out as they "build" the railway, while the younger engines could have a theme of recovering or resurrecting engines in the GY as "preservation" gets underway. At least one could have a recovery effect on being detached from an EARTH Machine Xyz Monster.

As a Victorian Irish Broad Gauge locomotive, its ATK/DEF should total 5300.
