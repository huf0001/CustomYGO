Basis: The Amiens Gun, a 28 cm SK L/40 "Bruno" railway gun (SK = Schnelladekanone, or quick-loading cannon; L = Länge, or having a 40 caliber barrel) captured by the Australian military during WWI and returned to Australia.
Flavour: A smaller railway cannon than the Rank 10/11 Superdreadnought Rail Cannons, but still a powerful cannon nonetheless.
