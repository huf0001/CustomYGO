COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

K class should have a pure black or royal blue and yellow livery.

Older engines could have a theme of getting the others out as they "build" the railway, while the younger engines could have a theme of recovering or resurrecting engines in the GY as "preservation" gets underway. At least one could have a recovery effect on being detached from an EARTH Machine Xyz Monster.
