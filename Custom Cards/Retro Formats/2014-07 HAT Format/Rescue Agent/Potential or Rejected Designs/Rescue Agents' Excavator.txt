COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Xyz monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Xyz monsters of attaching monsters destroyed in battle rather than sending them to the GY. As a 2-material Rank 4 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000.

Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Xyz / Effect
Rank: 4
Attribute: EARTH
Monster Type: Machine
Materials: 2 Level 4 "Rescue Agent" monsters
Effect(s): Once per turn: You can detach 1 material from this card, then target 1 set Spell/Trap your opponent controls; shuffle it into the Deck. Your opponent cannot activate the targeted card or its effects in response to this effect's activation.

ATK: 2400
DEF: 1600
Comments: Extra Deck monsters should all share the same battle effect. Also, the archetype should only have 1 Spell/Trap removal monster, so let's see if a different effect can work for Excavator, or if it should keep its Spell/Trap removal and Submarine should use a different effect.
