CREATIVE-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flavour: A Horus support monster that temporarily upgrades Horus to its next level, or turns it into a Spell Jinzo for the opponent if it's already LV8.
Artwork: Created in GIMP using:
● Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV4
● Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV6
● Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV8
● Sacred Phoenix of Nephthys
● Shadow's Light
● Spirit of the Pharaoh


COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Keep an eye on if this effect needs to be limited to hard once per turn. Also, test with:

● Weaker versions of the next Horus' effect rather than the full versions
● No bonus effect at all, and Horus just gains ATK. In this case, perhaps Temple of the Black Flame Dragon could take this part of the effect for itself and just apply it continuously, instead of the current iteration's effects.
● No Quick Effect status, forcing you to use it on your turn and preventing you from using it reactively to protect Horus LV4 from Spell effects.

Also, there was a comparison made on Reddit between Osiris and Blackwing - Kalut the Moon Shadow (LV3 / DARK / Winged Beast / 1400 ATK / 1000 DEF) whose effects read: "During the Damage Step, when your "Blackwing" monster battles (Quick Effect): You can send this card from your hand to the GY; that monster gains 1400 ATK until the end of this turn." which is a stronger ATK boost, but more restricted in its application, and without other benefits.

Comments: Extending the power up to the next turn to enable locking down the opponent if used on LV6 during your turn without a successful kill, or to enable a successful kill if used to lock down during the opponent's turn.

Comments: Let's try simplifying to granting ATK and effects, which is more powerful, before increasing complexity to reduce power.

Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Effect
Attribute: FIRE
Monster Type: Warrior
Rules text: ① If this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the GY: You can add 1 "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV4" from your Deck to your hand.
ATK: 900
DEF: 0
Comments: This effect feels too defensive or self-detrimental, perhaps something to facilitate upgrading one Horus to the next more quickly. Horus LV8 can't upgrade further, so perhaps designing it in such a way that Horus LV8 also gets a benefit?

Name: Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV2
Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Effect
Attribute: FIRE
Monster Type: Dragon
Rules text: ① During the End Phase, if you control this face-up card your opponent owns: Return control of this card to its owner. ② During your Standby Phase: You can send this card to the GY; Special Summon 1 "Horus the Black Flame Dragon LV4" from your hand or Deck.
ATK: 900
DEF: 0
Comments: Had a look at some Goat format Horus decks, and the way they try to get Horus on the field would not be helped by Horus LV2's effect as is, and adding Masked Dragon to try and facilitate its summoning method would force you to consider removing the combos for cheating out Horus LV6. Needs re-working to provide helpful support.
