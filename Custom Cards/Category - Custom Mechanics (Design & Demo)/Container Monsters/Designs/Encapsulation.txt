Card Type: Rule
Rules Text: 
① Container Monsters are Effect Monsters that appear on the field as the result of a card's effect. They're not included in the Deck, so when they're sent anywhere except the field, e.g. to the hand or GY, they are removed from the field instead. 
② Container Monsters can have cards placed inside them, except Container Monsters. 
③ If a Container Monster is empty, stack another copy of that Container Monster under it face-down. 
④ When a card is placed inside a Container Monster, stack it under that Container Monster face-down, replacing the face-down copy of that Container Monster stacked underneath it. 
⑤ Monsters inside a Container Monster are still treated as being on the field for the purposes of cards, effects, etc. applied to that monster that would be destroyed or removed if that monster left the field (e.g. Equip Spells, counters, lingering effects), as well as for cards or effects that check or count which monsters are on the field (e.g. "Cyber Dragon", "Harpie's Pet Dragon"). 
⑥ Container Monsters don't always have the Level, Rank, Link Rating, Pendulum Scale, Attribute, monster type, ATK, or DEF properties. Only Container Monsters with one or several of those properties listed have those properties. Cards that interact with monsters based on those properties cannot interact with Container Monsters that do not have them. 
⑦ Container Monsters without an ATK or DEF property cannot attack, and players take no battle damage from those battles. 
⑧ Container Monsters cannot be Tributed for a Tribute or Special Summon, used as material for the Special Summon of a monster from the Extra Deck, attached to an Xyz Monster, or removed from the field to pay a cost. 
⑨ When a Container Monster leaves the field, send the card inside it (if any) to the GY. 
⑩ When the effects of a Container Monster are negated (e.g. by "Skill Drain" or "Effect Veiler"), remove it from the field. (This does not apply if a Container Monster's effect is activated and the activation or effect is negated (e.g. by "Memory Loss" or "Skill Prisoner").) (Cards and effects that would negate the effects of a Container Monster are not considered to be cards or effects that would remove it from the field.) If a monster was inside it, return that monster to the field in that Container Monster's zone, in the same battle position it was in when it was placed inside that Container Monster, instead of sending it to the GY.

Comments: Handling some edge cases I forgot to deal with, as well as some general stuff of what a Container Monster is, similar to the rulebook's text for that for Token Monsters.
