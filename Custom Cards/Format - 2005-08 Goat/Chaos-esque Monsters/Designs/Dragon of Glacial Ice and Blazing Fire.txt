Card Subtype(s): Effect
Level: 6
Attribute: WATER

Rules Text: Cannot be Normal Summoned/Set. Must be Special Summoned (from your hand) by banishing 1 FIRE and 2 WATER monsters from your GY. Once per turn: You can discard 1 card, then target 1 monster on the field; destroy that target. 
ATK: 2300

Comments: First, let's bring the Summoning condition up to par with Chaos monsters: must first be Special Summoned this way, and only requires 1 monster of each Attribute. Next, higher ATK so it can at least beat over Chaos Sorcerer. And let's add 1 additional effect a la BLS-EotB to make it stronger. Also, if BLS-EotB can banish monsters for free, why is Frost and Flame Dragon destroying for discard? Lastly: multiple Attributes and types.
