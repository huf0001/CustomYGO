TCG Magical Hats:
Normal Trap
During your opponent's Battle Phase: Choose 2 Spells/Traps from your Deck and 1 monster in your Main Monster Zone. Special Summon them as Normal Monsters (ATK 0/DEF 0) in face-down Defense Position, Set the chosen monster if it is face-up, and shuffle them on the field. The 2 cards chosen from your Deck are destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase, and cannot remain on the field except during this Battle Phase. 

Anime Magical Hats:
Normal Spell
This card's effect caused four large hats to appear on the player's side of the field while they had a Magician in play. The player could then hide any of their cards on the field inside them. (If a new card was placed underneath a hat, the hats' positions on the field would be randomly shuffled again.) Furthermore, it was also possible to hide multiple Spell/Trap Cards inside a single hat. The opponent would have to target one of the hats for their attacks or effects without knowing what lay underneath them. If the attacked hat was empty, it would be immediately destroyed. In the case it had a monster in it, the battle with that monster would proceed as usual, and in the case a Spell/Trap Card was hidden underneath, that card would then be activated, if possible.

Comments: More changes to handle stuff I hadn't thought of previously, and to handle other stuff better.

Card Subtype(s): Container/Effect
Rules Text: ① Does not prevent monsters from being Summoned/Set in this card's Monster Zone. ② During your Main Phase as Chain Link 1, OR during the Battle Step or at the start of the Damage Step if this card is attacked, OR if a card or effect is activated that would make this card leave the field, including as a result of "Hats of Illusion - Magical Hats's" effects or by game mechanics (Quick Effect): You can destroy this card and apply 1 of these effects, based on the type of card inside this card (if any). ● Monster: Return that monster to the field in this card's Monster Zone in the same battle position it was in when it was placed inside this card, and if this card was targeted for an attack, card, or effect, change the target to it. ● Spell/Trap: If its activation timing is correct: activate it as if it was activated in the same Chain Link as this effect.

Comments: Removing the check for effects that would remove Magical Hat from the field due to game mechanics or "Hats of Illusion - Magical Hats", as those would remove it by dispelling the hat, not destroying it and triggering anything inside it.
