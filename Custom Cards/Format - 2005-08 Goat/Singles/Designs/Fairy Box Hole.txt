COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

TCG Fairy Box:
Continuous Trap
When your opponent's monster declares an attack: Toss a coin and call it. If you call it right, the attacking monster's ATK becomes 0 until the end of the Battle Phase. Once per turn, during your Standby Phase, pay 500 LP, or destroy this card.

Anime Fairy Box:
Normal Spell
All Attack Position monsters on your side of the field are hidden in a box to disrupt enemy attacks. 
The box in question functioned like a Whac-A-Mole game, whereby any opponent's attacking monster had a chance of either hitting or missing its attack target as it rapidly popped in and out of the box's multiple holes. Furthermore, if the field was somehow covered in water, like through the effect of "Umi", the box itself would end up underwater and any monsters unable to breathe underwater that were hiding in it would be forced outside.
