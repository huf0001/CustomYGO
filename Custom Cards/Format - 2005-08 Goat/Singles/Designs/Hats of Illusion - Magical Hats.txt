TCG Magical Hats:
Normal Trap
During your opponent's Battle Phase: Choose 2 Spells/Traps from your Deck and 1 monster in your Main Monster Zone. Special Summon them as Normal Monsters (ATK 0/DEF 0) in face-down Defense Position, Set the chosen monster if it is face-up, and shuffle them on the field. The 2 cards chosen from your Deck are destroyed at the end of the Battle Phase, and cannot remain on the field except during this Battle Phase. 

Anime Magical Hats:
Normal Spell
This card's effect caused four large hats to appear on the player's side of the field while they had a Magician in play. The player could then hide any of their cards on the field inside them. (If a new card was placed underneath a hat, the hats' positions on the field would be randomly shuffled again.) Furthermore, it was also possible to hide multiple Spell/Trap Cards inside a single hat. The opponent would have to target one of the hats for their attacks or effects without knowing what lay underneath them. If the attacked hat was empty, it would be immediately destroyed. In the case it had a monster in it, the battle with that monster would proceed as usual, and in the case a Spell/Trap Card was hidden underneath, that card would then be activated, if possible.

If it is a Spell/Trap, if its activation timing is correct, you can activate it as if it was activated in the same Chain Link as this effect, otherwise send it to the GY. ● If a "Hat Token" leaves the field, except by the above effect, send the card banished by "Hats of Illusion - Magical Hats" with its column recorded (if any) to the GY. ● If you control only 1 "Hat Token", or a card or effect is activated that would negate the effects of "Hats of Illusion - Magical Hats", activate the effect before last for all "Hat Tokens" you control, ignoring its activation requirements.
