COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Using non-standard templating of "and, after that" to indicate both A and B are required but sequential, which doesn't have a PSCT conjunctive to indicate it, by combining "and" (A and B required, simultaneous) and "then" "A required but not B, sequential) in the same manner that "also, after that" (neither A or B required, sequential) adapts "also" (neither A or B required, simultaneous).

Making "Fortress Whale's Oath" a "Ritual" Spell to allow it to Special Summon "Fortress Whale", as I made "Fortress Whale" require a "Ritual" Spell to be Summoned, so as to preserve most Ritual Monsters being able to be Ritual Summoned using generic Ritual Spells.
