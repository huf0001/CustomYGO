CREATIVE-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basis: Zombie Warrior
Flavour: In Yugi and Pegasus's first duel, Yugi anticipates that Pegasus knows he has Zombie Warrior, so instead he topdecks Dark Magician. Skeleton Soldier is a Zombie Warrior retrain that anticipates that your opponent knows you have it in your hand, so it searches for a new Zombie monster to play instead of it.
Artwork: Created in GIMP using:
● Zombie Warrior
● Zombie World
● Eye of Illusion
● Ritual Weapon (as reference material)

ATK: 1200

Comments: Gonna switch from placing the leftover cards on the bottom to shuffling them into the Deck to maintain consistency with other Zombie searchers that have to shuffle the Deck after searching.
