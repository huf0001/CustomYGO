Egyptian gods archetype, Obelisk is Set. Slifer as Osiris: power made up of multiple pieces, when something enters his domain, it gets judged. Obelisk as Set: sacrifices others to kill enemies, bringing destruction and chaos and suffering. Ra: gains power from others because all get fused with him or offer prayers to him, can destroy anything given he embodies the power of the sun 

That plus the narrative parallels between Atem and Osiris and Kaiba and Set and Yugi and Horus, and Slifer and Obelisk being equals under Ra just like Osiris and Set are brothers and equals under Ra lines up too perfectly.
