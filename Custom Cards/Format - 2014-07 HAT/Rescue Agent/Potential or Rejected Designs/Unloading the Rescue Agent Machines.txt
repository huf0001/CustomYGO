COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Check other token makers and see if 2 Rescue Agent Machine Tokens is worth discarding a monster for, and playtest to see if the discard might actually be helpful for cases like getting Butler from the hand into the GY. If it would be better without discarding and Summoning 2 Tokens for Synchro Summons is weak enough to not require discarding as a cost, could milling or banishing from the GY become the cost if needs to have one?

If you Xyz Summon a "Rescue Agent" monster, except during the turn this card was sent to the GY: attach 1 "Rescue Agent" monster in your GY to that Xyz Summoned monster, and if you do, banish this card.
Comments: The quick Xyz Summon effect got merged into Launch of the Rescue Agents, so this card is adopting The Rescue Agents Assemble's effect. Also, might want to change the GY effect, since this card is no longer related to Xyz Summoning.
