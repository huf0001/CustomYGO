COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a Level 6 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000. 

Maybe consider moving Mobile Platform's ATK/DEF effect to Recon Jet, seeing as Mobile Platform doesn't have two materials to get a third effect, and the stat boost is unrelated to the token it summons. Or maybe not, since that would disincentivise using Recon Jet as Synchro material.
