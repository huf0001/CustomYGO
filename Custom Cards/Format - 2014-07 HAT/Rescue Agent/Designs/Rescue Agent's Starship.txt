COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a Level 8 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 5000.

Keep an eye on if the Extra Deck Summon Quick Effect is too useful in combat, and it should be restricted back to "During your opponent's Main Phase, you can (Quick Effect):".

Name: Rescue Agent's Starship
Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Synchro / Effect
Level: 8
Attribute: LIGHT
Monster Type: Machine
Rules Text: 1 Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner "Rescue Agent" monsters
If this card is Special Summoned: target 1 Level 4 or lower monster from either player's GY or banishment: Special Summon it. You can only activate this effect of "Rescue Agent's Starship" once per turn. Monsters destroyed by battle with this card are shuffled into the Deck instead of going to the GY. Once per turn: You can target 1 other monster on the field; change it to face-up Attack Position or face-down Defense Position.
ATK: 2700
DEF: 2300
Comments: There's some imbalance in utility between Carrier and Starship, so let's try swapping some effects: Carrier gets Starship's on-Summon effect, Starship gets Carrier's Quick Effect, and Starship's battle position effect becomes an on-Summon effect. Also, let's see how that effect fares being restricted to Synchro Summons, not just whenever it's Special Summoned. As for the Quick Effect, let's see how it goes being allowed to be used at any point you can activate a Quick Effect, but with a hard once per turn restriction. Also, the Quick Effect can be shortened slightly.

Comments: Special Summoning any monster from the GY might be a bit much, since you can use Sumbarine or Recon Jet to Synchro Summon this card, then revive them immediately.
