Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Effect
Level: 4
Attribute: WATER

Rules Text: If a "Rescue Agent" monster is Normal or Special Summoned to your field (except during the Damage Step): You can Special Summon this card from your hand.
ATK: 1400

Comments: Due to effect swaps among the Rescue Agent Synchro monsters, Astronaut and Aquanaut's effects should be swapped, since Astronaut's effect better maps to Submarine's new effect than Aquanaut's. Might also see how it performs as a Summon effect rather than a return to hand effect. For consistency with other Rescue Agents' adjustments, it shouldn't be able to Summon itself from the GY.
