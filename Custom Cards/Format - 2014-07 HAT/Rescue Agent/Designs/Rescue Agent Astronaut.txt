Name: Rescue Agent Astronaut
Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Effect
Level: 4
Attribute: LIGHT
Monster Type: Warrior
Rules Text: If this card is Normal or Special Summoned: You can target 1 "Rescue Agent" monster in your GY; add it to your hand.
ATK: 1300
DEF: 1600
Comments: Due to effect swaps among the Rescue Agent Synchro monsters, Astronaut and Aquanaut's effects should be swapped, since Aquanaut's effect better maps to Starship's new effect than Astronaut's. Also, might see how it performs when Summoning from the GY, rather than just returning to the hand. For consistency with other Rescue Agents' adjustments, it should also prevent it from Summoning itself in response to the Summon of another copy of Astronaut, and to keep its self-Summon rate consistent with Scientist and Engineer, it should only be able to Summon itself once per turn that way.
