COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a 2-material Rank 4 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000.

Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Xyz / Effect
Rank: 4
Attribute: WIND
Monster Type: Machine
Rules Text: 2 Level 4 "Rescue Agent" monsters
Once per turn: You can detach 1 material from this card; Special Summon 1 "Rescue Agent Machine Token" (Machine/EARTH/Level 2/ATK 0/DEF 0). "Rescue Agent" monsters you control gain 300 ATK/DEF for each "Rescue Agent Machine Token" you control. Monsters destroyed by battle with this card are attached to this card instead of going to the GY.
ATK: 2000
DEF: 2000
Comments: The battle effects of all Rescue Agent Extra Deck monsters should be made the same. Also, wanting to use Tokens for Synchro plays works against wanting them for ATK, so perhaps the ATK gain effect should be adjusted to encourage using the Tokens, not holding onto them.
