Basis: Old Vindictive Magician

Effect(s): ① If this card is Normal or Flip Summoned: Change this card to Defense Position, and if you do, place 1 Spell Counter on it (max. 1). ② Cannot be destroyed by battle while it has a Spell Counter on it. ③ You can remove 1 Spell Counter from this card, then target 1 monster on the field; destroy that target.
ATK: 900

Comments: Removing the Summoner Monk nod. This way, Summoning it with Powerful Apprentice Magician will give you the FLIP monster experience of being in Defense Position, since, if you're Summoning it from the hand, it'll be more aggressive.

Comments: Removing the indestructability, might be a bit over-par if Breaker is banned for being Spell/Trap removal and its only bonus from having its Spell Counter is 300 ATK.
