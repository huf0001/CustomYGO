Name: Unloading the Rescue Agent Machines
Card Type: Trap
Card Subtype(s): Normal
Effect(s): Target 1 "Rescue Agent" monster in your GY; Special Summon it, then, immediately after this effect resolves, Xyz Summon 1 "Rescue Agent" Xyz monster using monsters you control as material. If you Xyz Summon a "Rescue Agent" monster, except during the turn this card was sent to the GY: attach 1 "Rescue Agent" monster in your GY to that Xyz Summoned monster, and if you do, banish this card.
Comments: The quick Xyz Summon effect got merged into Launch of the Rescue Agents, so this card is adopting The Rescue Agents Assemble's effect. Also, might want to change the GY effect, since this card is no longer related to Xyz Summoning.
