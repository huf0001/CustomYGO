Basis: FAB 1
Flavour: The high-tech Rolls Royce owned by Lady Penelope and driven by Parker, with hidden features and gadgets to aid in its missions.


COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Fusion monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Fusion monsters of returning monsters destroyed in battle to the hand rather than sending them to the GY. As a Level 6 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000.
