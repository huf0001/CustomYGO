CREATIVE-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basis: Thunderbird 1
Flavour: A fast reconnaissance jet for scouting the danger zone and making preparations so Thunderbird 2 can deploy the vehicles it carries as soon as possible.


COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a Level 6 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000.

Comments: Is being able to Summon from the Deck a bit too strong? Let's see how it fares only being able to Summon from the hand.
