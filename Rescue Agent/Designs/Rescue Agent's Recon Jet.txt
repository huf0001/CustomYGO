CREATIVE-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basis: Thunderbird 1
Flavour: A fast reconnaissance jet for scouting the danger zone and making preparations so Thunderbird 2 can deploy the vehicles it carries as soon as possible.


COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Synchro monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Synchro monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a Level 6 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000.
