CREATIVE-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basis: The Excavator
Flavour: An excavator cabable of breaking up and clearing away rock and rubble, and drilling through to trapped victims.


COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Xyz monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Xyz monsters of attaching monsters destroyed in battle rather than sending them to the GY. As a 2-material Rank 4 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000.
