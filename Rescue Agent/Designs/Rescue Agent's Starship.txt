Basis: Thunderbird 3
Flavour: A space rocket for rescue missions in outer space.


COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Synchro monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Synchro monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a Level 8 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 5000.
