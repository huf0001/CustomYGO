CREATIVE-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basis: Thunderbird 4
Flavour: A submarine for under-water and sea-based rescue missions.


COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Synchro monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Synchro monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a Level 6 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000.
