Basis: Thunderbird 4
Flavour: A submarine for under-water and sea-based rescue missions.


COMMENTS-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As a "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monster, it should share the archetypal effect of all "Rescue Agent" Extra Deck monsters of shuffling monsters destroyed in battle into the Deck rather than sending them to the GY. As a Level 6 "Rescue Agent" monster, its ATK/DEF should add up to 4000. Keep an eye on if its Spell/Trap removal should prevent the opponent from activating the target in response (i.e. "Your opponent cannot activate the targeted card or its effects in response to this effect's activation."). Also, should it banish itself after self-rescurrecting, or return to the Extra Deck?

Name: Rescue Agent's Sumbarine
Card Type: Monster
Card Subtype(s): Synchro / Effect
Level: 6
Attribute: WATER
Monster Type: Machine
Materials: 1 Tuner + 1+ non-Tuner "Rescue Agent" monsters
Effect(s): Monsters destroyed by battle with this card are shuffled into the Deck instead of going to the GY. You can only use each of the following effects of "Rescue Agent's Sumbarine" once per turn. If this card is Special Summoned: You can target 1 face-up card your opponent controls; return it to the hand. If you Fusion, Synchro, or Xyz Summon a "Rescue Agent" monster while this card is in your GY: You can Special Summon this card, but banish it when it leaves the field.
ATK: 1600
DEF: 2400
Comments: If Excavator is moving away from Spell/Trap removal, this card can go back to being Spell/Trap removal, not anything removal. Also, let's see how that effect fares when restricted to Synchro Summons only, not any Special Summon, and not preventing the opponent from using that card in response.

Comments: Both this and Excavator deal with Spells and Traps, might need to distinguish them better so they're not filling the same role. Also, Rescue Agent cards shouldn't be destroying anything with card effects.
